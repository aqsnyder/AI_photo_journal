# My Photo Journal

My Photo Journal is a web-based application that allows users to create daily journal entries and automatically includes photos from their Google Photos library for the day. This MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is designed for personal use and will eventually be developed into a more robust platform with user accounts and database integration.

## Features

- **Daily Journal Entries**: Write journal entries each day and automatically save them for future reference.
- **Photo Integration**: Automatically fetch and display photos from your Google Photos account based on the current date.
- **File-Based Persistence**: Journal entries are saved locally in a file for easy access and backup.
